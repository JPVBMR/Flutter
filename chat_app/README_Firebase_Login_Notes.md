# Implementing User Login Logic and Key Concepts
> A simple overview on how authentication works.

1. **User Credentials Collection**:
    - Users provide their credentials (email and password).
    - These credentials are sent to the backend for validation.

2. **Credential Validation**:
    - Unlike the signup process, where credentials are stored, the login process involves validating the credentials to ensure a valid email-password combination.
    - Firebase handles this validation for us.

3. **Authentication Token**:
    - Upon successful validation, the backend generates an authentication token.
    - This token is a cryptic string created using an algorithm that ensures its uniqueness and security.
    - The token is sent back to the frontend to be stored and used for accessing protected resources.

4. **Protected Resources**:
    - Authenticated users may need to access certain protected resources on the backend (e.g., chat messages in a chat app).
    - Requests to these resources must include the authentication token for verification.

5. **Token Lifecycle**:
    - The token has an expiration time and needs to be managed.
    - Firebase SDK handles the storage and lifecycle of the token, ensuring it is renewed as needed.

## Steps to Implement User Login Logic

1. **Prepare the Login Form**:
    - Ensure you have a form where users can enter their email and password.

2. **Firebase SDK Setup**:
    - Make sure the Firebase SDK is correctly set up and configured in your project.
